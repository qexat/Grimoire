# Grimoire

Grimoire is a compilation of silly and interesting Python snippets I've written.

## Snippets

- An ALU tested with a custom tester ([source](./alu_and_tester.py))
- The unknown arrow operator ([source](./arrow_operator.py))
- Functions as infix operators ([source](./as_infix_operators.py))
- A "Hello World!" in Brainfuck... all in one f-string ([source](./bf_hello_world.py))
- It's time to du-du-duel! ([source](./combat_simulation.py))
- From pointers to functional programming? ([source](./confused_c_and_haskell.py))
- These items know they're in a sequence... ([source](./context_aware_sequence_items.py))
- The reinvented wheel of context managers ([source](./context_managers_reinvented.py))
- Haskell told me that functions are types anyway ([source](./functions_as_types.py))
- Buffer? Hardly know her ([source](./pty_as_buffer.py))
- Now that's a clean implementation of the Fibonacci sequence! ([source](./silly_fib.py))
- There can be only one... ([source](./singleton.py))
- Debugger? Ha- I already made this joke. But yeah. Thanks Annie for this ~~dumb~~ I mean clever idea. ([source](./waffle_debug/))
- Weird list type. Kinda looks like the V programming language, idk. ([source](./weirdass_list.py))
